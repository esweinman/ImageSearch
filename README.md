# ImageSearch

https://esweinman.github.io/ImageSearch/

<h3>Demostrated here is a mini search engine made with a React.js framework with images implemented from the Unsplash API  (https://unsplash.com/developers). Some CSS design also supported with Axios (https://github.com/axios/axios). The site is designed so that each image is rendered in their original state and not reshaped to be all the same size.</h3>
